# Sonic 1 SMS Remake PS3
A port of the fangame **Sonic 1 SMS Remake** for the **PS3**.

1. **Competition has been removed.** Unfortunately, it is not possible to implement it.

2. **If you evoke "SAVING" in a row, the game will freeze for a few seconds (10~15s).** This is due to how the PS3 saving system works.
To avoid this, especially in the menu selection, **when "SAVING" shows up, wait a few seconds until it finishes.**
You do not need to wait during main gameplay, since "SAVING" only happens in the end of each Act.3.

3. Labyrinth underwater character colors are not really what they should be. This is related to the way the PS3 handles the shaders.

4. The save file won't have the identification of the game name in the PS3 OS. It will be a generic icon, without name.

**Big Special Thanks goes to**: Creative Araya, SilicaAndPina, **MEGAgameBoy**, **DropSonic** and the **Sonic Time Twisted Devs**.
